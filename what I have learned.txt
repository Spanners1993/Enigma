THIS WORKS:
for letter in l:
        newLetter = rotor_1.get(letter)
        newList.append(newLetter)

THIS WON'T WORK:
for letter in l:
        letter = rotor_1.get(letter)

BECAUSE:
Think about iterating through the for loop on the non-working one. letter and newLetter need to be a seperate variable!
LESSON:
Don't piss around with the thing you are iterating through in the for loop.


== and = are different:
= assigns a value to a variable
== this checks whether two expressions give the same value


You have to declare variables as global INSIDE functions. wtf


To make decryption easier: Need to add a reflector rotor!
PROBLEM: How am I going to write the code for putting signals back through the rotor?
POTENTIAL SOLUTION: Write new dictonaries with backwards rotors

LESSON:
Doing repetitive tasks manually can lead to mistakes.
I accidentally overwrote one of my rotor dictionaries with another rotor dictionary! Had to go through step by step to find.
